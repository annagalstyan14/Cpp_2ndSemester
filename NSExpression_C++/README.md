🧮 NSExpression in C++

This project is a C++ implementation of Swift’s NSExpression class, designed to serve as a fully-featured, extensible mathematical expression parser and evaluator.

Inspired by the power of NSExpression, this version supports:
	•	📐 Arithmetic operations (+, -, *, /, ^, etc.)
	•	🧠 Built-in mathematical functions (sin, cos, log, sqrt, etc.)
	•	🧮 Operator precedence and associativity
	•	🧩 Tokenization, parsing, and evaluation from scratch
	•	🔧 A modular design using Lexer, Parser, Evaluator, and Utility components

It’s structured as a learning project to understand expression parsing and tree evaluation using clean, object-oriented C++.
